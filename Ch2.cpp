Chapter 3: Storing Data in C++

//make the r version of the following code 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int mynumber;
mynumber = 10;
cout << mynumber << endl;
return 0;
}

ChatGPT:
To write an equivalent version of the provided C++ code in R, we can make use of basic R syntax. Here's how it would look:
R Version:

# Assign value to variable
mynumber <- 10

# Print the value to the console
print(mynumber)

Explanation:
    <- is used in R for assignment (equivalent to = in other languages like C++).
    print() is used in R to output values to the console, similar to cout in C++.

Output:
This will display 10 on the R console, just like the C++ program.
